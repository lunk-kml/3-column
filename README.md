## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS External Stylesheet
- Mobile-first workflow
- VS Code Editor
- Google Chrome (for Inspect mode)
- px to rem convert extension

### What I learned

- It's better to start with mobile version before desktop version
- @media Query (to create another version)
- Using "rem" instead of "px"
  Using "rem" helps improve your performance by resizing fonts between different screens and devices. For more accessible website, use rem instead of px. REM does not just apply to font size, but to all sizes as well.

- CSS---
  font-stretch: ultra-condensed;
  ***

### Continued development

- Still want to improve making responsive websites friendly to both version of mobile and desktop.
- Still want to improve using CSS Grid and Css Flex
- Need more practice on @media query
- Need to get more comfortable with making element appear next to each other

### Useful resources
